# Nodecore Vulcan Improved
The new and improved version of NC Vulcan. 
Not a port but based heavily on the voxelmanip code from 'Magma Conduits' by Facedeer.
Changes pumwater generation to be more realistic, including pumwater conduits, volcanoes, hydrothermal vents on the seafloor, and more!
#Improvements over the my 'nc_vulcan':
- changed vulcanization nodes to groups
- added 'pumcrete', ('scoria' if wc_strata installed), a new concrete type!
- warmstone covering around pumwater conduits to reduce abm bogging
- merged functionality from "PumMINE", toggleable by setting
- made hydrothermal vents toggleable by setting
- made vulcanization effects toggleable by setting
- obsidian & obsidian-tipped tools
